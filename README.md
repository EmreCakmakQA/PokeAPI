# PokeAPI

This is a basic Front-End project designed to showcase the use of the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/), created [Paul Hallett](https://phalt.github.io/) and other [PokéAPI contributors](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi#contributing) around the world. Pokémon and Pokémon character names are trademarks of Nintendo. This project is intended for educational purposes.

# How Does It Work?
You simply enter the name of the pokemon you wish to obtain information about. Once the API call is successful, you will receive: the name, height, weight, move list, and pictures of the Pokemon. Other features will be added throughout the course of the project.
